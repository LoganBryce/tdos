KITE POWER

generates power through the power of the wind using kites, kinda like a wind turbine with no pole.
there are many types of kites, some have generators on the kite, while others have theirs on the ground.
they come down when there is not enough winds or in lightining storms but are erected in areas known to have many wind storms.
they are flown incredibly high up nad move incredibly fast. currently there are no commercial aribonre
wind turbines in regular operation.

one succesfull company; "makani" partly funded by google[x] (a secret company that exists on a boat in international water to avoid
building permits which would expose their purpose) has been making generator-bearing kites since 2006.
