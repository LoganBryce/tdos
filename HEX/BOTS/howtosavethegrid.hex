/*
Someone (Sam) asked about saving the whole grid,
so here is how to do that

NOTE:
due to the way JS treats objects and the fact that
arrays are objects in JS, you cant just set 'savedGrid'
to grid as that would create a reference to it and changing
savedGrid would also change grid, for this reason i created
a function 'clone()' which sets each value individually as to
remove the references.
*/

//ON OUR FIRST TURN
if (turnCount == turn) //cool little trick
{
savedGrid = new Array();
}
else
{
/*HERE IS WHERE WE WOULD DO STUFF WITH THE PREVIOUS SAVED GRID*/
}

//SAVE GRID
/*We only want to save if we are actually in game
so we validate its the game calling this function
(and not the error checker)*/

if (valid())
{
savedGrid = clone(); //thats it
}

/* below is the same but without comments
so you can copy it XD

if (turn == turnCount)
{
savedGrid = new Array();
}
else
{
//ACCESS GRID
}

//SAVE GRID
if (valid())
{savedGrid = clone();}
